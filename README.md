Introduction/Background: A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. You can briefly explain your dataset and its features here too.

Problem definition: Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?

Methods: What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Methods may change when you start implementing them which is fine). Students are encouraged to use existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) instead of coding the algorithms from scratch.

Potential results and Discussion (The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that's why it is called research). A good way to talk about potental results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics).

At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

Add proposed timeline from start to finish and list each project members' responsibilities. Fall and Spring semester sample Gantt Chart. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

A contribution table with all group members' names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task.This part does NOT count towards word limit.
